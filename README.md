This is an implementation part of YashCoin, a cryptocurrency.
Apart from the source code, you need to download Truffle Ganache, Postman API and My Ether wallet.
I recommend using Spyder(Anaconda 3) to run the code and Postman which will be used to run our API which will be hosted.
The Solidity code needs to be implemented on remix IDE and then copy the bytecode and ADI after successfully running and compilation on remix IDE.
The copyed bytecode and ADI will be pasted on My Ether Wallet.
For more information check the software websites.
